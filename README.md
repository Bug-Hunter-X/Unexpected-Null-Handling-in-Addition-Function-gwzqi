# Unexpected Null Handling in Addition Function

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with null handling in a simple JavaScript addition function. The function `foo` is designed to handle null values gracefully; however, it may not handle all scenarios robustly and could lead to unexpected outcomes or errors in a more complex program.

## Bug Description

The bug lies in the simplicity of the null check and the lack of comprehensive input validation.  While the code addresses null values directly, it doesn't check for other potential issues, such as non-numeric inputs, which could lead to incorrect results or runtime errors. 

## Solution

The solution improves input validation to ensure only numbers are processed. This prevents unexpected results from non-numeric input.  The solution also improves the code's readability and maintainability.
